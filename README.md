Haskell implementation of `untyped` from TAPL
---------------------------------------------

This is a Haskell implementation of the untyped lambda calculus implementation
from chapter 7 of [Types and Programming
Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).

The code is from <https://code.google.com/p/tapl-haskell/> and originally
written by Ryan W. Porter and released under the BSD3 licence.

I (@ehamberg) have split out the `untyped` code from the full repository,
cabalized it and fixed some minor issues.
